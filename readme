This folder contains MOM6 configuration files,
i.e. MOM_parameter_doc.all, for all the simulations 
used in the paper Kong & Jansen (2020).

The files differ by their suffixes. Each suffix has 3 components:
the topography/sponge layer setup, the eddy parameterizations setup,
and the peak wind stress setup. The way they are named are,

Topography/sponge setup:

1) cn1 refers to the setups with full topography and no sponge layer;
2) cn3 refers to the setups with flat bottom and no sponge layer;
3) cn6 refers to the setups with full topography and sponge layer;
4) cn9 refers to the setups with flat bottom and sponge layer.

Eddy parameterizations setup:

1) p1 refers to 0.1 deg simulations (i.e. eddy-resolving);
2) G7/G6/.../G1/G0 refers to \kappa_GM = 700/600/.../100/0 m^2/s;
3) GVp015 refers to the Visbeck parameterization;
4) GoMap12 refers to the (original) MEKE parameterization;
5) GnMap12 refers to the topographic MEKE parameterization. 

Peak wind stress setup:

tp0/05/1/2/3 refers to peak wind stress \tau_0 = 0/0.05/0.1/0.2/0.3 Pa
