### What this folder is for

This folder contains MOM6 configuration files (MOM_parameter_doc.all) for the simulations used in the paper by Kong & Jansen (2020).

### What files are what
Each file provides specific MOM6 parameters for each simulation that's used in the paper. The suffixes of filenames briefly denote how each simulation is configured. Each suffix has 3 components: the topography & sponge layer setup, the eddy parameterization, and the peak wind stress. Below are how each component is named.

#### For the topography/sponge setup:

- cn1 refers to the setups with full topography and no sponge layer;
- cn3 refers to the setups with flat bottom and no sponge layer;
- cn6 refers to the setups with full topography and sponge layer;
- cn9 refers to the setups with flat bottom and sponge layer.

#### For the eddy parameterizations:

- p1 refers to the 0.1 degree simulations (i.e. eddy-resolving);
- G7/G6/.../G1/G0 refers to \kappa_GM = 700/600/.../100/0 m^2/s eddy parameterizations;
- GVp015 refers to the Visbeck parameterization;
- GoMap12 refers to the (original) MEKE parameterization;
- GnMap12 refers to the topographic MEKE parameterization. 

#### For the peak wind stress:

tp0/05/1/2/3 refers to peak wind stress \tau_0 = 0/0.05/0.1/0.2/0.3 Pa
